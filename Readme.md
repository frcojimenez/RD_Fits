# The project
 
The RD_Fits project aims at producing accurate ringdown (RD) fits that describe the final state of binary black hole mergers. <br>
The RD emerges as the late trail of radiation usually represented as a sum of damped sinusoids and its modelling is essential to test general relativity (GR) in its most extreme regime. The code is ready to reproduce the results of references [1,2,3,4] 


# Prerequisites

To fully and succesufully use all codes stored here, one needs to have the following codes and versions installed:
* Python ≥ 3.0 along with the qnm package and the numpy package;
* The qnm package
* Ideally the pynr package, that can be found here:  'https://github.com/frcojimenez/pynr'


# Structure

In this repository one can find: 
* ringdown_fits.py . The main package;
* RD_Fits.ipynb. A example notebook with the main results;
